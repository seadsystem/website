Kind of in order of priority:

Handle rooms with no appliances properly

Add a way to add appliances
    - Not sure how this will work when disaggregation arrives, but need a temporary method

Clean up CSS
    - Device view and rest of website consistent
    - Modules lign up on device view

Add loading spinner to device page
    - still not ideal, we should use synchronous requests because the website still hangs when changing date range

Avoid reloading cost graph on every action room change

Implement room editing for name/icon

Home tab should show appliances if there are no rooms
    - Ideally there should be a way to query the SEADS backend for all appliances the device has found

                    - roomid (unique id) // As is there is not an easy way to rename a room
                        - name: Kitchen
                        - appliances
                            - Panel1 // The appliance id should be the key not its name
                                - name: Oven
                                - color: brown
                            - Panel2
                                - name: Refridgerator
                                - color: gray
                    - roomid (unique id)
                        - name: Unsorted // Newly recognized appliances show up in an unsorted tab
                        - appliances
                            - Panel3
                                - name: Unnamed Device
                                - color: random

                                - name: Unnamed Device
                                - color: random
    ....

Add customization in terms of which modules are shown that stay consistent across sessions

rewrite javascript for device page.... it's really bad as is :(

Beautify the appliance sorting module

Beautify rest of the website

Ask for confirmation before deleting a user's device
